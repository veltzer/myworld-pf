- find out how to make new maven targets
	and have one targets that builds deploy etc.
- find out how to do command line completions right for maven.
- find out how to print dependencies in maven.
- add a jetty plugin to maven and have easy running without
	external tomcat.

- protect the API key (don't have it in the code).
	right now it is in: src/main/webapp/gmap.xhtml

- I can't run this project using tomcat and secure deployment on my laptop
	because I don't have the keys (I think).
	~/.keystore
	~/.keystore.tomcat.cer
	Have a script here to create those files.
